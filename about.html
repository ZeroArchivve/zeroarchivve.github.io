      MISSION STATEMENT
    </h3>
    <p style="line-height: 2; color: var(--light-gray); text-align: center; margin-bottom: 1rem;">
      Zero:Archive is a collective of six sound designers united by a single purpose:
      to push the boundaries of electronic music through complex, experimental sound design.
    </p>
    <p style="line-height: 2; color: var(--light-gray); text-align: center;">
      We believe that sound is more than just music—it's a medium for exploration,
      expression, and experimentation. Every project we undertake is an opportunity
      to discover new sonic territories and challenge conventional listening.

      <p class="artist-bio">
        We embrace risk and uncertainty. Every track is a laboratory,
        every session an experiment. We're not afraid to fail—
        because failure often leads to the most interesting discoveries.

        is the foundation of creative freedom.

      <h3 class="artist-name">INNOVATION</h3>
      <p class="artist-bio">
        We don't follow trends—we create them. Our goal is to make music
        that sounds like nothing else, using techniques that haven't been
        tried before. Innovation isn't a choice; it's a necessity.

      <h3 class="artist-name">ACCESSIBILITY</h3>
      <p class="artist-bio">
        While our music is complex, we believe it should be accessible.
        We share our knowledge, techniques, and processes openly,
        contributing to the broader sound design community.

      <h3 class="artist-name">INTEGRITY</h3>
      <p class="artist-bio">
        We make music for ourselves first. Commercial viability is secondary
        to artistic vision. We release what we believe in, not what we think
        will sell. Authenticity is non-negotiable.

      HISTORY
    </h3>
    <p style="line-height: 2; color: var(--light-gray); margin-bottom: 1rem;">
      Zero:Archive was founded in early 2026 by six producers who met through
      online sound design forums and Discord servers. Despite coming from different
      backgrounds—ranging from academic electroacoustic composition to underground
      techno production—we discovered a shared passion for experimental sound design
      and complex sonic textures.
    </p>
    <p style="line-height: 2; color: var(--light-gray); margin-bottom: 1rem;">
      The name "Zero:Archive" reflects our philosophy: "Zero" represents the blank slate,
      the starting point of every creative process, the moment before sound exists.
      "Archive" represents documentation and preservation—our commitment to capturing
      and sharing the experimental processes that lead to finished works.
    </p>
    <p style="line-height: 2; color: var(--light-gray);">
      We operate as a true collective: all decisions are made democratically,
      all revenue is split equally, and all members contribute to both creative
      and business aspects of the label. This egalitarian structure allows us to
      maintain artistic freedom while building something sustainable.

      OUR PROCESS
    </h3>
    <p style="line-height: 2; color: var(--light-gray); margin-bottom: 1rem;">
      We work entirely in-the-box using a variety of DAWs and synthesis tools.
      Our shared sample library contains thousands of custom-designed sounds,
      field recordings, and synthesis patches. We maintain a private Discord server
      where we share works-in-progress, provide feedback, and collaborate on tracks.
    </p>
    <p style="line-height: 2; color: var(--light-gray);">
      Each release goes through a rigorous collective review process. We believe
      that multiple perspectives make every track stronger. Our standard is simple:
      if even one member isn't satisfied, we keep working.
    </p>
